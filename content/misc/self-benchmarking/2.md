## Finding Suitable Metrics

To reiterate, the goal of this benchmarking is to **maximize the amount of things done**.

I think there are two main factors that affect this metric:
1. How much time is actually spent doing tasks
2. How effectively time is spent doing tasks

Both factors are not very straightforward to improve, as they tend to get better with practice. However, some measures for anti-procrastination and anti-distraction may help to speed up the progress for the first factor.
